# PdfMerger
The application helps me in my current job to combine many waybills placed on four pages to fit one page. As soon as possible I will add the possibility of merging many pdf files into one pdf file and several pdf files into any sheet size on one page (e.g. 2x1, 2x2, 4x1, 1x1, etc.). A supplementary function to be added is the possibility to rotate pdf files.
